# aslsp

An extremely simple front-back HTTP app written in Go, packaged as Docker containers, and deployable in Kubernetes.

## Deploy

1. `aslsp.yaml`
2. `bacque.yaml`
3. `craque.yaml`

TODO: The environment variables and how they get set is not working, so I'll have to fix that before I can make this a 'release' of any kind.

TODO: Also want to shape up the prom stuff.

TODO: Oh yeah some tests would be pretty swell.
